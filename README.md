### What I learned

This is my first coding project. I made this project by myself. I started working on this landing page from creating mobile version. I spend four hours on thinking about html construction. After taking courses, at the begining I was hoping that this project will be easy. I quickly found out that it was going to be harder than I expected.

I gained knowledge of:

- making html structure
- using CSS Flexbox and Grid
- using BEM
- and many more

This project isn't perfect and I know it, but I am happy I did it. In the future I will add JavaScript code and finish this project.
